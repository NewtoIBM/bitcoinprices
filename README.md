# bitcoinprices
this project is Time Series analysis/ Bitcoin prices dataset is taken from public sources. Then I applied ARIMA and Facebook Prophet to it in effort to predict next day or next month or next hour prices of bitcoin. Predictions was very close to real but in real life prices changes more unpredictable because there too many predictors should be engaged in more accurate predictions.
